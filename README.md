# fcc_state
Command line program to process  EN.dat extracted from fcc's l_amat.zip

This program makes file fcc_states.tab file that is used with my git branch cqrlog/states.
File is placed to ~/.config/cqrlog/ctyfiles folder and holds callsign=state pairs that are used in 
WSJT-X CQ-monitor to get up to date US states view.

l_amat.zip must be loaded first. Either with web browser or command line program wget.
From zip the EN.dat must be extracted. unzip is the command line program for this.
After that EN.dat is processed with this program.
